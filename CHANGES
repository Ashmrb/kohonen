The kohonen package version 2.0.0 is described in 
R. Wehrens and L.M.C. Buydens, J. Stat. Softw. 21(5), 2007

Changes in version 2.0.1:
  - fixed a bug in unit.distances: for rectangular maps the toroidal
    argument was ignored. Updated the corresponding example as well.
  - added an argument 'n.hood' to functions som, xyf, bdk and
    supersom, so that the user can decide what distance measure to use
    when calculating distances between units. Useful to compare the
    results with other som implementations.
  - specification of radius as (start, stop), similar to alpha. This
    gives better control (suggestion of Hadley Wickham).
  - more sanity checking in functions som, xyf, bdk and supersom 
    (suggestion of Hadley Wickham).
  - added the J. Stat. Softw. paper and a CITATION file to the distribution.

Changes in version 2.0.2:
  - changed the 'predict.kohonen' function to take account of a change
    in the behaviour of 'aggregate' in R version 2.6.0 and later

Changes in version 2.0.3:
  - removed a bug in supersom, introduced in 2.0.1 when checking if
    the data are numeric.
  - added an example for supersom.
  - removed a bug in plot.kohcounts, arising when empty units are
    present
  - updated man files for methods 'plot', 'predict', and 'map'
